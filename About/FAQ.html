          <a href="#panel1">Are you guys beekeepers?</a>
          <div id="panel1" class="content">
            <p>We started this project as newbs (non-beekeepers) but have become beekeepers along the way. Essentially we’re a group concerned citizens who have worked hard to gather the design abilities, beekeeping knowledge and electronics skills of many, and focused them into a project that we believe can make a difference to the the plight of honeybees.</p>

          <a href="#panel2">Where can I find a “CNC router” to make one of your hives?</a>
          <div id="panel2" class="content">
            <p>Although they might sound hard to find, CNC routers are in fact quite abundant. Any town with a well equipped woodshop, a business making custom cabinetry, or a FabLab, Makerspace or TechShop will likely have a CNC router. Like a lot of technology, these machines are also becoming cheaper each year, so they’ll become increasingly accessible as time goes on. Please check out these links below to find the CNC router nearest to you:</p>

          <a href="#panel3">Why did you develop these beehive designs?</a>
          <div id="panel3" class="content">
            <p>A lot of people (especially beekeepers) have asked this question--and it’s a reasonable one. Many hive designs out there have been used for hundreds of years, and they work, so why design new ones?</p>
            <p>First of all, our designs have been heavily informed by two long existing designs: the Kenyan Top Bar, and the Warré (also called the "ruche populaire" or "The People's Hive"). So they’re not really “new”. What we’ve done, is take these designs and re-jig them to comply with digital manufacturing technologies. This means that anyone with access to a CNC router can produce our hives without needing a lot of time (they cut in about an hour) or woodworking experience. It’s also scalable (meaning you can produce many hives in a short period) and cheap (you only have to buy a sheet of plywood, and an hour on a CNC machine). Also, both designs flat pack, so they can be shoved in any car, taken home, and assembled in minutes (without screws or glues).</p>
            <p>Finally, because the designs are open source, we can all work together to improve and share them until they become the most developed designs available! If you’d like to help us improve our designs or develop a new one, please see our <a href="http://www.opensourcebeehives.net/Collaborate/get_involved.html">Beehive Collaboration</a> area.</p>

          <a href="#panel4">Why are you using plywood material?</a>
          <div id="panel4" class="content">
            <p>We use plywood because it’s a relatively cheap and accessible material that comes in standard sheet sizes. Some have observed that plywood does not last well in extreme outdoor environments. We have found this can be somewhat remedied using a non-toxic varnish such as linseed oil, but we agree that for some environments it is not the ideal material. That being said, there are a huge variety of plywoods available, and we are still experimenting. Our ultimate vision is to use recycled plastic or insulation sheet materials such as EcoSheet which are waterproof, rot resistant and upcycled. The important thing to remember is that our designs can be applied to almost ANY 4’x8’ sheet material, and there are many options out there other than plywood.</p>
            <p>If you have any suggestions for plywoods or other materials we may not know about, please let us know <a href="http://community.opensourcebeehives.net">on the forum</a>.</p>

          <a href="#panel5">What will your sensors detect?</a>
          <div id="panel5" class="content">
            <p>Our sensor kits aim to generate insights into what’s causing the mass die offs of bees around the world. To do this, we will need a number of reliable, accurate sensors monitoring a variety of environmental factors in the hive, and a large community to implement them around the world. We aim to detect:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Colony mood - using audio sensors</li>
              <li>Pesticide detection - using volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors</li>
              <li>Bee numbers - using infrared sensors</li>
              <li>Hive temperature - using temperature sensors</li>
              <li>Hive humidity - using humidity sensors</li>
              <li>Hive location - using GPS devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Later iterations may also include weight sensors to monitor honey production and small cameras to monitor the hive interior.</p>

          <a href="#panel6">When will your sensors be ready?</a>
          <div id="panel6" class="content">
            <p>As of writing (September 2014) our team are nearing the first iteration of our sensor kit, known as the “Alpha Kit”. We hope to have the second “Beta Kit” ready in Q4 of 2014. These first two kits will be test versions used by our core sensor team to prepare for a public release of the system, which will be available to order from our website once ready. We aim to have this first public release available in Q1 of 2015.</p>
            <p>If you have skills in software or electrical engineering, and would like to join our sensor development team, please contact us on the <a href="http://community.opensourcebeehives.net">forum</a> or via <a href="mailto:hello@opensourcebeehives.net">email</a>.</p>

          <a href="#panel7">How will your project make a difference?</a>
          <div id="panel7" class="content">
            <p>A lot of research is currently being conducted into bee decline. As you may know, serious research often costs serious money. To acquire this money, research institutes must often go to private companies to fund their work. Increasingly, this money is coming from the exact companies accused of causing the problem, such as pesticide producers Monsanto, Bayer and Syngenta. There are even more worrying examples of companies purchasing bee research institutes. To make a long story short, modern bee research is increasingly conducted and controlled by the powerful companies causing the problem.</p>
            <p>If you’re as outraged by this as we are, what would you say to the idea of decentralising the study of bees? Of putting innovative research tools into the hands of many citizens, rather than corporate-funded institutes? By using the power of the Internet to collaboratively study the problem, are doing things differently. We work under the premise that crowd sourced data is a more neutral, less compromisable way to studying important environmental issues.</p>
            <p>With the help of our community, we want to create, share, and study what is harming bees around the word. With our findings, we will build evidence that can be used by scientists, activists, and organisations to push the changes needed to address and prevent bee decline.</p>

        </dd>
        <dd class="accordion-navigation">
          <a href="#panel8">Why is “open source” relevant to this project?</a>
          <div id="panel8" class="content">
            <p>“Open source” means that anyone can share and build on our work without needing permission (so long as they share their own contributions openly as well). You can take our designs, make them, change them, or even sell them if you want. We believe that bypassing patents and intellectual property encourages innovation and increases accessibility and collaboration.</p>
            <p>Some have made the point that many beehive designs have been “open source” for a long time. This is true. We’re not claiming to be the first people to share beehive designs. What we want is to encourage people to collaborate and develop the best beehives and sensors available to humanity (and bees). Distributed collaboration via the internet and digital manufacturing are allowing us to do this in a way that wasn’t possible before. </p>
            <p>Additionally, our sensor data will be openly available to the public in “open source” fashion. This is an important feature of the project, as it will allow anyone from a scientist to a hobbyist gardener to download, study, and draw insights into what is causing bee decline for themselves.</p>
            <p>To us, these forms of transparency, sharing and open collaboration give us no choice but to operate under the name Open Source Beehives :-)</p>
